# byLLM Task Manager v1

>This version demonstrates a simple, single-file agentic implementation. All logic for tasks, email, and chat is contained in `main.jac` for clarity and ease of understanding.

## Main Files
- `main.jac` - All agent logic (tasks, email, chat) in one file
- `utils.jac` - Utility functions
- `.env` - Environment variables (email credentials, etc.)
- `mydatabase/` - Local storage for tasks and sessions

See the main code in `main.jac` for details.

**Note:** v2 improves modularity, scalability, and maintainability by splitting code into multiple files and abstracting core logic.
